Anime-Image-generator-GANs-

Overview This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate anime-style images. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, trained in tandem to produce realistic images. The goal of this project is to create unique anime character faces leveraging the power of GANs.

Features Generative Adversarial Network:

Utilizes a GAN architecture to generate anime-style images. Trained on a dataset of anime character images for learning distinctive features. It takes random noises as input and generate images as output.

Dataset:

Trained on a curated dataset of anime character images. You can extend or replace the dataset to tailor the generator to your specific needs.

Architecture of GANs:
